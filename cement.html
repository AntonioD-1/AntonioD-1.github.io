    <h2>Photograph</h2>
    <p>The camera had existed for centuries prior to the Industrial Revolution. However, during that time, a man named Nicephore Niepce
    invented the first photograph so people could preserve their camera pictures. It took eight hours for the photograph to be printed,
    so Nicephore started working with Louis Daguerre.
    
    With further improvements by William Henry Fox Talbot, the first negative was invented. The camera slowly improved over
    time, and a memorable photograph was taken in 1877 to see if a horse's feet all left the ground when it galloped.</p>
