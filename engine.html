    <h2>The Steam Engine</h2>
    <p>Steam engines are what power steamboats, factories, and locomotives. They utilize boiling water and hot steam to push
    a piston back and forth and power a machine. Steam-powered machines proved to be reliable, easy to use anywhere,
    and powerful.</p>
   <p>The steam engine was created by Thomas Savery in 1698. 80 years later, a man named James Watt made heavy improvements
   to the power and speed of the steam engine, making it much more useful; a unit of power called the Watt was named after him.
   Steam engines are still in use today.</p>
